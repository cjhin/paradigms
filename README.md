A lightweight remote desktop framework utilizing cherryPy.

The core idea/advantage over normal remote desktop programs is an emphasis on a lightweight, accessible anywhere, and modular program.

Lightweight: A simple cherryPy server that can be run on any computer with Python. (and hopefully we can turn it into a simple executable for anyone to run)

Accessible Anywhere: Once the server is running on the desired "host" computer, it can be accessed by any device in the world with access to an internet connection.

Modular: Taking cues from Unix; small, simple modules that perform one task.  This helps contribute to the lightweight nature of the program.
